An ode to oats
The humble oat

sown, grown, watered, flourished, picked, plucked, chaffed, stored, hauled, carried, and delivered
milled, stoned, ground, heated, pressed, dried, rolled, chopped, chipped, and packaged
soaked, salted, sweetened, cooked, baked, roasted, toasted, and topped

the majestic oat
