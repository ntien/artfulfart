### Sharing art in community

Quaranzine art collections coming soon.

```markdown
are you interested in contributing some art to the Quaranzine series?

# It can be Corona virus related
## or not!
### It can be whatever type of art you want!

- audio
- video
- visual; drawing, painting, collage
- food

What is the purpose of this site?
1. To encourage people to make art
2. To have a communal space to share that art

**Art** is _Therapy_ and `we` could all use some healing.
